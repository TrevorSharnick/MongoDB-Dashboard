# MongoDB-Dashboard

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

- Some of the main ways you can write maintainbable, readable, and adaptable is to ensure that the code is reusable. One method of doing this is to break your code down into smaller, reusable functions; each with their own specific task. For example, the CRUD python module contained a few methods such as create(), read(), read_all(), update, and delete() methods. Each method performed a basic but vital component of CRUD module functionality when it comes to handling data in a database. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

-  When approaching problems as a computer scientist, one of the best practices is to break down large problems into smaller, more manageable ones. To do this effectively, the first step should be identify and understand the project requirements. For example, one of the requirements Grazioso Salvare requested was to develop create, read, and write methods for the animal database. To do this, I spent time reading the documentation for Mongo Database and best CRUD practices before I started writing the code for the methods. 


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

- Computer scientists are tasked with working on a wide range of different kinds of projects which involve solving problems. As many different industries integrate with technology, a computer scientist is responsible for helping develop the technologies necessary for a seamless transition. In the case of the Grazioso Salvare project, the database and dashboard projects helped to streamline the animal center database and helped all the company to gain valuable insights into their data including the ability to sort through the database by location or catagory.
